                    <p> Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world.[1] Owing to the relative ease and low cost of raising them 
                        in comparison to animals such as cattle or hogs, chickens have become prevalent throughout the cuisine of cultures 
                        around the world, and their meat has been variously adapted to regional tastes.
